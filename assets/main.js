// Complete the questions below; we'll go over these at our next class meeting.
// The skills covered in these questions are DIRECTLY related to the notes sheet
// called Basics of JS.

// 1. Declare a variable whose value CANNOT change called `favCourse`
const favCourse = `Geography`;
// Note: This variable should be a string.

// 2. Log the value of `favCourse` to the console
console.log (favCourse);
// 3. Create a variable whose value CAN change called `grade`
let grade = `98`
// Note: this variable should be an integer

// 4. Log the value of `grade` to the console
console.log(grade);

// 5. Create a variable whose value is a Boolean called `isHope`
let isHope = true;
// You should set it dependent upon if there is/is not hope for your grade
// in said course.

// 6. Log the value of `isHope` to the console.
console.log(isHope);

// 7. Write a statement using the format below wherein your variables are "plugged in"
console.log(`My favorite course is ${favCourse}. My grade is a ${grade}. Hope:${true}`)
// The console should read: My favorite course is Geography. My grade is a 98. Hope: true.
